# Official iOS Benchmark App

This directory is reserved for the official community benchmark app.

The app is data-collection infrastructure for iOS-LLM-Leaderboard. It is not a
starter app for developers to copy into unrelated products.

## Purpose

The app should allow an iOS developer to:

1. install the official runner on a physical device;
2. select a compatible model profile and benchmark release;
3. run a locked, reproducible procedure;
4. review local results and every field proposed for submission;
5. submit a result bundle with minimal manual work.

The project cannot depend on one maintainer owning every iPhone and iPad model.
The app is the intended path for community device coverage.

## MVP Scope

- physical iPhone support first;
- automatic public device and OS metadata;
- versioned model profiles;
- MLX Swift as the first runtime adapter;
- local benchmark execution with no network dependency during measured phases;
- progress, cancellation, and failure reporting;
- summary and raw-run result export;
- contributor review before upload;
- local use without mandatory submission.

## Intended Submission Flow

1. The app exports a versioned result bundle.
2. A submission service or GitHub App validates the upload.
3. A pull request or bot-managed repository submission is created.
4. Repository automation performs structural and semantic checks.
5. The result enters the appropriate evidence level.

The app must not write directly to the default branch.

## Data Boundary

Expected benchmark metadata:

- public device model and chip;
- OS version and build;
- benchmark app and release version;
- model artifact, quantization, and runtime identity;
- inference settings;
- timing, token, memory, thermal, and failure evidence;
- integrity hash.

The app should not collect Apple ID, serial number, UDID, personal prompts,
user documents, or unrelated app data.

## Architecture Direction

The runner should use a runtime adapter boundary so that benchmark semantics do
not depend on MLX Swift.

Later adapters may support:

- llama.cpp;
- Core ML;
- Apple Foundation Models where equivalent measurements are possible;
- future Apple-platform runtimes.

## Current Implementation

The repository now includes a minimal SwiftUI Xcode project targeting iPhone
on iOS 26 or later. It provides:

- a Run Benchmark screen that displays the locked pilot configuration;
- public device, OS, and thermal-state inspection;
- a runtime-neutral `LanguageModelRuntime` boundary;
- a runner that executes one warm-up followed by five measured attempts; and
- unit tests proving that warm-up and failed attempts remain distinguishable.

The pinned MLX Swift LM adapter is connected to the Run button. The first run
downloads and caches the fixed Qwen3 artifact; generation starts only after the
snapshot has been materialized. The app does not generate simulated
measurements and does not upload results.

The current runner calculates TTFT, MLX-reported prefill throughput, decode
throughput, token-interval percentiles, sampled process physical footprint, and
thermal state. It preserves warm-up and measured token events in a local pilot
bundle, shows median measured-run values, and exports the raw JSON through the
system share sheet.

The result view also shows first-to-last performance degradation and expandable
details for every measured attempt. Warm-up evidence is displayed separately
and remains excluded from summary aggregation. The on-screen thermal state is
refreshed after a run and on pull-to-refresh instead of remaining at its
launch-time value. A run can start only from the system-reported `nominal`
state. If the state reaches `critical`, the current generation is retained and
remaining generations are recorded as `notRun` instead of being started.

Raw bundle schema `suite-b-pilot-bundle-0.3` records separate decisions for
session validity, cold performance, sustained performance, thermal stability,
and official leaderboard eligibility. A transition from `nominal` through
`fair` to `serious` is valid thermal evidence; it is not filtered out for
being slower. Official eligibility remains false while the protocol is a
non-official pilot.

The bundle is written after the complete session, not after each individual
attempt. Per-attempt checkpoint recovery and Framework v1 repository export
remain follow-up MVP steps, so this build must not yet be used to publish
official results.

Open `BenchmarkApp.xcodeproj` in Xcode, select an Apple Development team, and
choose a physical iPhone. The first pilot environment is an iPhone 14 Pro Max
running iOS 26.5 with Xcode 26.5 (17F42).

### Measurement preflight

Run the benchmark without LLDB attached: open **Product → Scheme → Edit
Scheme → Run → Info**, turn off **Debug executable**, and then run the app on
the physical iPhone. The app detects an attached debugger, disables the Run
button, and explains how to detach it. This avoids an Xcode 26.5 debugger
detach failure observed after MLX/Metal inference; launching and stopping the
same app without inference does not reproduce that failure.

Exported pilot bundles record whether a debugger was attached, the Debug or
Release build configuration, and the app version and build. A Debug build is
acceptable for this pilot when **Debug executable** is off; the build
configuration remains evidence and should not be mixed silently in later
comparisons.

## Current MVP Design

The first physical-iPhone harness pilot is specified in
[MVP-BENCHMARK-SPEC.md](MVP-BENCHMARK-SPEC.md). Its machine-readable plan,
fixed workload, and placeholder export fixture live under `benchmark-plans/`,
`workloads/`, and `fixtures/` respectively.

These files freeze an implementation target; they do not contain benchmark
results and do not make the draft pilot eligible for a leaderboard.
