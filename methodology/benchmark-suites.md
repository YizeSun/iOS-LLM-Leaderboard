# Framework v1 Suite Namespaces

iOS-LLM-Leaderboard retains five independent suite namespaces in Benchmark
Framework v1. They organize stable IDs, historical tasks, methodology, and
evidence ownership during migration.

These namespaces are not the public product architecture. Product Phase 1 is
Power + Ship, while Build is a Phase 2 Research Track. The authoritative mapping
is documented in [Product Architecture](../docs/product-architecture.md#suite-relationships).

- Suite A and Suite C are retained for compatibility and Phase 2 Build research.
- Suite B is the active measurement foundation for Phase 1 Power.
- Suite D is potential later Power quality evidence and is not active in Pilot
  v0.1.
- Suite E is potential later Ship integration evidence and is not executed or
  scored in Pilot v0.1.

Namespace membership does not create a shared score or equal product priority.

## Suite A: Swift Code Generation

Suite A evaluates whether an LLM can generate production-quality Swift and SwiftUI code.

Example categories:

- SwiftUI
- Navigation
- Animation
- List
- Charts
- Widgets
- Networking
- SwiftData
- CoreData
- CloudKit
- StoreKit2
- Concurrency
- MVVM
- Testing
- Accessibility
- Performance

Typical scoring:

- Compile success: 30%
- Functional correctness: 30%
- Swift idiomatic quality: 20%
- Modern Apple API usage: 10%
- Readability and architecture: 10%

## Suite B: On-device Performance

Suite B evaluates local model performance on Apple devices.

Suite B is the first implementation priority. A physical-iPhone pilot runner
exists, but it remains non-official while the workload-centric v2 protocol is
designed and validated.

Example metrics:

- TTFT
- prefill tokens/sec
- decode tokens/sec
- peak memory
- thermal behavior
- energy usage
- token latency distribution
- p50 / p95 / p99 token interval

Suite B v2 uses user-experience workloads and pipeline profiles. The listed
metrics are collected together from compatible attempts rather than becoming
independent future tasks. See
[Suite B Protocol v2](../benchmarks/suite-b-on-device-performance/protocol-v2.md).

## Suite C: Xcode Integration

Suite C evaluates developer workflows inside Xcode-style environments.

Example categories:

- code completion
- inline fix
- refactoring
- compiler error repair
- documentation generation
- code explanation
- build-error recovery

## Suite D: App Feature Intelligence

Suite D evaluates model capabilities used inside real iOS apps.

Example categories:

- information extraction
- summarization
- translation
- structured output
- planning
- classification
- roleplay
- safety

## Suite E: Runtime Evaluation

Suite E evaluates local inference runtimes and model-runtime pairs. It compares runtimes, not only models.

Example runtime targets:

- MLX Swift
- CoreML
- llama.cpp
- LiteRT-LM
- Apple Foundation Models
- future Apple runtime APIs

Suite E must clearly state whether a task evaluates a runtime, a model, or a model-runtime pair.

## Suite Boundaries

Do not mix Swift code generation tasks, app feature intelligence tasks, Xcode workflow tasks, runtime measurements, and on-device performance results.

Suite-level scores and reports should remain separate unless a future methodology defines a formal aggregate score.
