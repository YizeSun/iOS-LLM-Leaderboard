# Project structure and growth policy

This policy keeps a rigorous benchmark from becoming difficult to understand
or contribute to.

This file describes the current repository structure. The
[repository architecture and migration](repository-architecture.md) defines
the approved target and final activation gate. The `products/power/` tree is
hash-pinned; while `current.json` is absent, its candidate contracts must not
be treated as open public intake.

## Four layers

| Layer | Audience | Canonical paths | Rule |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Public surface | Developers and new contributors | `README.md`, website, `contributor-kit/`, current guides | One current answer and one current workflow per subject |
| Normative standard | Implementers and reviewers | `benchmarks/`, `schemas/`, `methodology/` | Versioned, reviewable, and immutable once pinned |
| Evidence | Auditors and ranking generators | `results/`, `submissions/` | Preserve raw bytes, failures, hashes, provenance, and generated derivatives |
| Maintenance | Project maintainers | `scripts/`, `tests/`, `.github/` | Automate validation without becoming a second product surface |

Complexity is acceptable in the normative and evidence layers when it protects
reproducibility. It must not leak into the contributor entry path.

## Stable top-level map

Do not add a new top-level directory unless none of these owns the content:

- `benchmarks/` — suite specifications and release contracts;
- `apps/` — candidate App shell and independently digestible runner modules;
  owned by App and runner maintainers, MIT licensed, source-evolving with
  released identities and component digests retained;
- `contributor-kit/` — the current short contribution path plus clearly
  labeled historical guides;
- `docs/` — product, governance, current methods, and retained decisions;
- `examples/` — focused integration recipes;
- `ios-app/` — official benchmark runner;
- `methodology/` — cross-suite benchmark conventions;
- `models/` — model catalogs and compatibility metadata;
- `products/` — versioned Product, Program, Target, and policy contracts;
  currently contains the Power 2 activation state, including its active
  Runner certificate and closed App build 3 release candidate; owned by
  product and methodology maintainers, CC BY 4.0, and immutable once released;
- `results/` — raw and generated evidence by release;
- `schemas/` — machine-readable contracts;
- `scripts/` — validators and deterministic generators;
- `site/` — website code;
- `submissions/` — contributor-owned packages;
- `tests/` — regression tests.

A pull request proposing a new top-level directory must document its owner,
lifecycle, license, and why an existing path is insufficient.

`products/` and `apps/` are the two approved additions during the clean-break
migration.
Existing `benchmarks/` remains the Power 1.1 archive and Suite-history plane;
it cannot own a product-neutral Program × Target registry, runner
certificates, and atomic product pointers without preserving the coupling this
migration is removing. The candidate remains fail-closed until
`products/power/current.json` and its immutable App release are issued
together.

The existing `ios-app/` is a historical Power 1.1 application. `apps/` is
needed because the approved Target model extends beyond
one iPhone project and requires the App shell, Runner Core, Program Modules,
Target Adapters, Runtime Adapters, and evidence serialization to be separately
testable and digestible. Candidate code under `apps/` is not certified or
public merely because it exists.

## Rules that prevent growth from becoming bloat

1. **One current public guide.** Update it instead of adding `new`, `final`,
   `v2`, or `latest` copies. Versioned historical records may remain, but they
   are de-indexed from the public path.
2. **One public command per product.** Power contributors use
   `scripts/power`. Release-specific tools may remain internal and are
   indexed in `scripts/README.md`.
3. **No duplicate deploy pipelines.** Only one workflow may deploy GitHub
   Pages.
4. **Generated outputs have one source.** A generated file identifies its
   generator and is checked in only when the website or release consumes it.
5. **Pinned assets are immutable.** A new contract receives a new version and
   path. Do not silently repair a released asset.
6. **Drafts are not public truth.** Draft protocols and research notes must say
   `Draft` and must not be the homepage methodology link.
7. **Failures remain evidence.** Simplifying navigation never deletes raw
   failed, OOM, cancelled, or ineligible attempts from a released evidence set.
8. **A–E stay navigable, not equally active.** Suite A/C are Build Research,
   Suite B is active Power, Suite D is future Power quality, and Suite E is
   future Ship evidence.
9. **No speculative infrastructure.** Do not add a runner, schema, workflow,
   or website view for an unapproved benchmark category.
10. **Every new public file removes ambiguity.** If it creates a second answer
    to “what is current?” it must replace or explicitly archive the old answer.
11. **Power and Ship stay separate.** A Benchmark App run produces Power
    evidence. Ship may cite accepted Power measurements, but its deployment
    profile is generated and reviewed separately; never describe Ship as part
    of a Power result or release.

## Review checklist for structural changes

- Does the homepage remain understandable without reading historical docs?
- Can a new result contributor reach a working command in two clicks?
- Is the normative source distinct from the short public explanation?
- Is an existing stable ID, raw result, checksum, or release manifest changed?
- Does the change introduce a second workflow, deploy job, or current guide?
- Are A–E roles still complete and accurately labeled?
- Do tests guard the public links and single-deploy rule?

Repository size is not the main metric. The goal is low cognitive load at the
entrance and complete evidence behind every claim.
